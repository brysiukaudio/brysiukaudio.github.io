    Hi, I'm Ben Brysiuk and this is brysiukaudio.ca my personal and professional website. I am an 
    audio technician and third year Electrical Engineering student. In the future, brysiukaudio will be separated 
    into three categories: Brysiuk Audio Equipment, showcasing the audio equipment I have built; 
    Brysiuk Audio Art, showcasing sound designs and sound installations I've created; and Brysiuk Audio 
    Technicial which provides an in-depth detail of my work as an audio technician. For now there is just Brysiuk
    Audio Equipment.
