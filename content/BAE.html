<p class = "paragraph">
	In third year at the University of Victoria, Electrical, Computer and Software Engineering students
	are required to complete a class that is intended to be the foundational research of their fourth year 
	design project. For my research project, my group and I chose a project from supervisor Dr. Peter Driessen's set
	of pre-approved projects called "Spinning Sound Source". The objective of the project was to create 
	a device that emulated the rotary sound of a Leslie Speaker using a dodecahedron speaker system. 
</p><br />
<p class="paragraph">
	In our original group meeting, before meeting with our supervisor, we worked through what we felt
	should be the general functionality of this speaker system. For our base case specifications, 
	we decided to require the following:
</p><br />
    <ul>
		<li>Take in a single input channel
		<li>Use onboard processing to spin the sound
		<li>Use a simple footswitch to turn on/off, vary speed, and change direction
	</ul><br />
<p class="paragraph">
	After meeting with Dr. Driessen, we were aware of his own specifications. He wanted us to use Max 
	to send multi-channel audio to the system via a RedNet Device. We made the decision to add this as an
	added feature to the final system as well as using Max via MIDI to control the speaker system.
	With that in mind, our group went about researching. We looked into analog and digital means of mixing
	between output channels, considered FPGA for system control, researched Max and RedNet, and considered if it 
	would be feasible to spin the speaker system mechanically.

	During this time, Dr. Driessen gave us a dodecahedron speaker that had been partially built by a previous group, so
	that it could be modified for our purposes. Unfortunately, the speaker system was missing so many parts and with 
	no budget, being a research class, we opted to continue our research and work towards a proof of software concept
	using Max. To do this proof of concept, we borrowed a six channel half-dodecahedron speaker from Kirk McNally
	in the School of Music. With the half-dodecahedron, a six channel audio interface, and a computer running
	a custom Max Patch, we were able prove, from a software stand point, we could make a Spinning Sound Source.

<p class="paragraph">
	With this proof of concept and the research, my group wrote our report outlining what we were able to accomplish
	with the current implementation that used the custom Max patch with pre-built multi-speaker systems, and what a future 
	implementation would entail. In the future, I plan on using this report and project to build the future
	implementation in my fourth year design class.

<!-- <h4><strong>Tilt Synth</strong><span class="rightjustify">Date: April 6, 2014</span></h4>
<p class="paragraph">
    I've been working on a musical instrument that is called the Tilt Synth. It's based on the 
    Open Hardware <a href = "http://bleeplabs.com/store/nebulophone/">nebulophone</a> by Bleep 
    Labs. Where the tilt synth is different is it swaps out the key and stylus for a tilting pad, 
    the potentiometers for digital encoders, and adds an LCD screen. Notes are generated by the 
    direction the pad is tilt and how deep the pad is pressed. Using digital encoders over the 
    potentiometers allows for interchangeable effects. The LCD screen displays the name of the 
    effect and value of the each encoders. Today mark the first day that I was able to start to
    build the synth. I wanted to test out some of the base code that I'll be adding to the 
    nebulophone sketch for the items that I'm adding. I solder the encoder and headers to the base
    breadboard and ran a quick test on the code. The headers act as a terminal to solder multiple 
    cables to
