<h4><strong>Technical career so far</strong><span class="rightjustify">Date: Dec 8, 2014</span></h4>
<p class="paragraph"> 
	I've worked as a professional audio technician for the past 7 years, less frequently in the last 2,
	and in that time I've had the opportunity to work a wide range of events and with a number of 
	different companies. I've chosen a few from my career to talk about here starting with the furthest 
	in the past.

<p><strong>Edmonton Festivals</strong></p>
<p class = "paragraph">
	I lived in Edmonton twice, in the summer between my first and second year in college and after 
	graduating from college for a year and a half. While I lived in Edmonton I had the opportunity to
	work The Next-Generation Arts Festival (NextFest) and the Edmonton International Fringe Festival (Fringe)
	in the Summer of 2007 and 2008. In 2007 for both festivals I worked as an production assistant. My 
	job mainly consisted of building sets for shows, running some NextFest shows, and maintaining the Fringe 
	site. In 2008 I was the Living Room Playhouse venue technician for NextFest, and my entire job was to set-up 
	and run the shows at the venues. I was the only technician so I	ran both lights and sound. I was also a venue
	technician for the Fringe that year. My venue was in the gym of King Edward School and I was ran the audio for 
	all the shows in that venue. It proved to be an interesting learning experience as I had three musicals in my 
	venue and extremely limited equipment, a couple difficult designers, and it was my first time working for the 
	theatre technician union. Ultimately working these festivals allowed me to create contacts in Edmonton that
	proved beneficial in working as a contract theatre technician.

<p><strong>Production Lighting</strong></p>
<p class = "paragraph">
	The majority of jobs I did while in Edmonton was with a company called Production Lighting (PL). They focused on 
	providing lighting for corporate events, festivals and concerts. I worked for them as a contract lighting 
	technician at first and then I ended up working full time after 6 months of working contract. At PL I ended up
	leading union crews; working with moving lights, moving light boards and other lighting automation; Working with
	other production companies to accomplish an event.

<p><strong>Edmonton Contract Work</strong></p>
<p class = "paragraph">
	On top of the work I did at the festivals and PL I also worked for different theatre companies installing sets,
	hanging lighting equipment, and running shows. I worked for Century Casino filling in for the monitor technician
	and working a followspot operator. The variety in these jobs allowed me to get much needed experience to make me
	a well rounded technician.
